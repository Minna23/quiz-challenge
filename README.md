# quiz-challenge
This challenge was part of my Frontend Development Bootcamp.
The requirements were the following:
- I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score

In this project I used 
## HTML, basic CSS, and JavaScript
